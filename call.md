title: Call For Papers - MAPS 2023
---

## Topics

The symposium welcomes papers on all aspects that combine software engineering, programming languages, and machine learning, including (and not limited to):

- Machine learning methods trained over source code, including applications to software development tools and program synthesis.
- Application of machine learning to compilation and run-time scheduling.
- Collaborative human/computer programming (i.e., conversational programming).
- Empirical studies on different aspects of large language models for code
- User studies and usability analysis of AI-based programming tools
- User interface and interaction design for AI-based programming tools
- Deterministic and stochastic program synthesis.
- Infrastructure and techniques for mining and analyzing large code bases.
- Interoperability between machine learning frameworks and existing code bases.
- Probabilistic and differentiable programming.
- Programming language and compiler support for machine learning applications.
- Programming language support and implementation of machine learning frameworks
- Neurosymbolic and intentional programming

## Format

Submissions must be in English, and papers should be in PDF and format with 4 to up to 8 pages. All the submission should follow the [ESEC/FSE 2023 Format and Submission Guideline](https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-how-to-submit). The submissions will be judged based on the merit of the ideas rather than the length. Submissions must be made through the online submission site.

MAPS 2023 is __non-archival__ and thus __dual submission__ is allowed where permitted by third parties.  Authors will have the option to decide whether having their final paper accessible from the workshop website or not.

## Important Dates

- Submission Deadline: August 15, 2023
- Author Notification: __TBD__
