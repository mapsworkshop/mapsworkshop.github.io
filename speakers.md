<b>Title:</b> Non-canonical Tasks for Synthesis and Learning
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The *canonical* synthesis task is to construct a correct program from a specification of intended program behavior. Learning methods have been very valuable at extending this paradigm, for instance to LLM-powered code completion in IDEs. This talk, however, discusses several tasks beyond the purview of canonical synthesis. This includes learning to predict whether a synthesizer should be trusted; using synthesis to generate programming problems (instead of using synthesis to solve programming problems); using synthesis to solve tasks in graphics and visual perception, and, time permitting, tasks in psychology and computational linguistics.

<b>Bio:</b> Kevin Ellis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. He works in AI and programming languages. Previously he received his PhD in Cognitive Science from MIT, and was a Research Scientist at Common Sense Machines.
