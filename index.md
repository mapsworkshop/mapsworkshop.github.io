## About MAPS 2023

The integration of programming languages, software engineering, and machine learning has the potential to transform software development by enabling new forms of human-machine collaboration. The recent development of pre-trained large language models for programming has introduced exciting possibilities for automating programming tasks, improving developer productivity, and enhancing code quality. However, there are still significant open research questions that need to be addressed in this emerging field.

The primary motivation of this workshop is to bring together researchers from programming languages, software engineering, and machine learning communities to discuss and explore the latest advances in machine learning models for programming. The workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers to share their ideas, exchange research results, and collaborate on new research directions.

The workshop aims to achieve multiple objectives by bringing together researchers from programming languages, software engineering, and machine-learning communities. Firstly, it aims to foster collaboration between the three communities, encouraging the development of new approaches for software development that can benefit from machine learning models. Secondly, the workshop provides a forum for researchers to present and discuss their latest research findings and ideas, thus enabling the exchange of knowledge and the identification of open research questions. Thirdly, the workshop aims to explore the challenges and opportunities of machine learning models for software development activities, with the goal of identifying new research directions in this emerging field. Fourthly, the workshop encourages the development of new models, algorithms, and tools for programming with machine learning models to improve software development efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, the workshop aims to discuss the ethical and societal implications of machine learning models for programming, promoting responsible development and deployment of this technology.

To achieve these objectives, the workshop will feature a combination of keynote talks, research paper presentations, panel discussions, and open discussions. The workshop will provide ample opportunities for researchers to interact, discuss, and collaborate on new research directions. We believe that this workshop will significantly contribute to the advancement of machine learning models for programming and will foster cross-disciplinary research between programming languages, software engineering, and machine-learning communities.
